1. Bronze Layer: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.
2. Silver Layer: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
3. Gold Layer: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.

## Project Overview
This project involve
1. Data Architecture: Designing a Modern Warehouse using Medallion Aechitecture Bronze, Silver, and Gold Layer.
2. ELT Pipeline: Extracting, transforming, and Loading data from source system into the warehouse.
3. Data Modeling: Developing fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical queries.
4. Analyticas & Reporting: Creating SQL-based reports and dashboards for actionable insights.

## ðŸš€Project Requirments

### Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)

### objective
Develop a modern data warehouse usinf SQL server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

### Specifications
- **Data Sources**: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.
-**Data Quality**: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.
-**Integration**: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendy data model designed for analytical queries.
-**Scope**: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required. 
-**Documentation**: Provided clear documentation on the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.
